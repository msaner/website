            <h1>What is So Cal Disc Golf?</h1>
            
            <p> So Cal Disc Golf is a community based group made up of people who live in the Southern California area. Our purpose is to promote the 
                sport of disc golf by organizing clinics and tournaments. We cater to all skill levels from beginner to pro's. Our members include men, 
                women and children of all ages. If you love getting outside and sports that involve skill, teamwork and social interactions disc golf is 
                the game for you.
            </p>
            <p class="p2"> In addition to bringing together the disc golf community in Southern California, we also advocate for the building of new disc 					
            	golf courses and the on-going maintenance of current courses. Disc golf has grown substantially in recent years and the demand for high 
                quality courses continues to increase. We work with local cities to find suitable sites for new courses and even help in raising the 
                funds to build and maintain them. Our members host clean up days from time to time so be sure to <strong>become a member</strong> so you 
                can find out about activities in your local area!

        <h1>Choosing The Right Disc</h1>
        
        <div id="column1">
            <p> Anyone that has ever played disc golf knows, <em>this is not a game of frisbee</em>. Choosing the right discs to put in your bag is 
                essential to having a good game. Heavier more stable discs will do better in strong winds, if you'll be throwing around tight curves 
                you'll need a disc with a lot of turn. Knowing the course you will be playing and the conditions you will be playing in will be very 
                helpful to you when you go to pick out your discs. Even the strength of your throw is important to know. With so many nuances things can 
                get confusing fast but don't fear! We are here to help!  
            </p>
        </div><!-- column1 -->
        
        <div id="column2">
            <p> If you're just starting out you will want to have one of each of the main types of discs. You can add more later when you get 
                more comfortable with your game. Starter packs are avaialable at most sporting goods stores like Dick's Sporting Goods, as well as 
                specialty shops. Distance drivers are going to be your go to disc right out of the tee box. These discs are designed for speed and 
                distance, when thrown right they should get you pretty far down the fairway.
            </p>
        </div><!-- column2 -->
        
        <div id="column3">
            <p> Next up are the mid-range discs which are fast and very stable. Mid-range discs are great all around discs and are a great 
                choice for new players. If you have trouble throwing your driver acurately try using your mid-range instead, the results might surprise 
                you. Last on the list is the putter, these are for short precision shots. Putters are very slow and have very predictable flight 
                characteristcis, when you get closer to the basket it's time to break out the putter to sink the shot and get in the chains!

        <h3>Disc Types</h3>
        
        <p> These are the three main categories of discs to know. There are many specialty discs for use in specific circumstances which fall under 
            various sub-catagories such as Long Drivers and Fairway Drivers that you can learn about as your skill increases.
