        <h1>What is So Cal Disc Golf?</h1>
        <p> So Cal Disc Golf is a community based group made up of people who live in the Southern California area. Our purpose is to promote the sport of 
        	disc golf by organizing clinics and tournaments. We cater to all skill levels from beginner to pro's. Our members include men, women and children 			of all ages. If you love getting outside and sports that involve skill, teamwork and social interactions disc golf is the game for you.
        </p>
        <p> In addition to bringing together the disc golf community in Southern California, we also advocate for the building of new disc golf courses and 
        	the on-going maintenance of current courses. Disc golf has grown substantially in recent years and the demand for high quality courses continues 
            to increase. We work with local cities to find suitable sites for new courses and even help in raising the funds to build and maintain them. Our 
            members host clean up days from time to time so be sure to <strong>become a member</strong> so you can find out about activities in your local 
            area!
